# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

The AddressInput component uses new forward geocoding API (/api/geocode/forward) returning {latitude, longitude} format, but App.js geocodeLocation expects legacy format {coordinates: {latitude, longitude}}. This prevents restaurant search from triggering after geocoding, so no restaurants display on frontend despite backend working correctly.

Heart icons are visible and clickable, user authentication works properly (login modal appears when not authenticated, registration successful), but clicking heart icons does NOT change their visual state (no fill-current class added), NO API calls are made to /api/users/favorites endpoints, and no favorites are actually saved. The toggleFavorite function in App.js is not working despite being called. User dashboard shows 'No favorites yet' even after clicking multiple hearts.

Database only contains mock restaurants with UUID IDs. RESULT: Users can successfully add Google Places restaurants to favorites (POST works), but GET /api/users/favorites returns empty array because it can't find the Google Places restaurants in the database. FIX REQUIRED: Modify get_favorite_restaurants function to handle both database restaurants (UUID IDs) AND Google Places restaurants (google_ prefixed IDs) by fetching Google Places data when needed. This explains why hearts turn red then gray - frontend adds to favorites successfully but retrieval fails."

ROOT CAUSE WAS: The get_favorite_restaurants function was using the legacy Google Places API (maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/place/details/json) which returned REQUEST_DENIED because legacy APIs are not enabled. SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED: Updated the function to use the new Google Places API (places.googleapis.com/v1/places/{place_id}) with proper headers and field masks, matching the same API used in restaurant search. COMPREHENSIVE TESTING RESULTS: ✅ Users can successfully add Google Places restaurants to favorites (POST /api/users/favorites/{id} works), ✅ GET /api/users/favorites now returns Google Places restaurants with complete details (name, address, rating, cuisine types) fetched from Google Places API, ✅ Mixed favorites work correctly (both database restaurants with UUID IDs and Google Places restaurants with google_ prefixed IDs), ✅ All 8/8 focused favorites tests passed.

Restaurant Search API returns 20 restaurants (Google Places integration working), User Registration/Login APIs work correctly with JWT tokens, Favorites Management APIs (add/remove/get) function properly with persistence. Mock restaurant data is loaded in database (11 restaurants with specials) but filtered by time-based special availability - this is correct behavior.

    message: "❌ CRITICAL ISSUE FOUND: Favorites functionality testing revealed a major bug in the frontend geocoding integration. The AddressInput component uses the new forward geocoding API (/api/geocode/forward) which returns coordinates in {latitude, longitude} format, but the main App.js geocodeLocation function expects the legacy format with {coordinates: {latitude, longitude}}. This mismatch prevents restaurant search from being triggered after geocoding, causing no restaurants to display on the frontend despite the backend API working correctly. User authentication works perfectly, but the core restaurant search functionality is broken due to this geocoding response format incompatibility."

    message: "❌ CRITICAL FAVORITES FUNCTIONALITY FAILURE: Comprehensive testing of the complete user favorites workflow reveals that while the restaurant search now works correctly (displaying 20 restaurants with visible heart icons), the core favorites functionality is completely broken. Key findings: 1) Heart icons are visible and clickable on all 20 restaurant cards, 2) User authentication works perfectly (registration, login, dashboard access), 3) However, clicking heart icons does NOT change their visual state (no fill-current class is added), 4) NO API calls are made to /api/users/favorites endpoints when hearts are clicked, 5) No favorites are actually saved or persisted, 6) User dashboard consistently shows 'No favorites yet' even after multiple heart clicks, 7) The toggleFavorite function in App.js appears to be called but is not functioning properly. This is a critical functionality failure that requires immediate investigation and fix by the main agent."

    message: "🔍 FAVORITES BUG ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED: Conducted comprehensive debugging as requested. EXACT ISSUE: Backend API mismatch between restaurant search and favorites retrieval. Restaurant search returns Google Places restaurants with IDs like 'google_ChIJlYL0Wa-BhYARJi6qr49Ncv0', users can successfully add these to favorites (POST /api/users/favorites/{id} works), but GET /api/users/favorites only searches db.restaurants collection which contains only mock restaurants with UUID IDs. Google Places restaurants are fetched dynamically, not stored in database. RESULT: 0 favorites returned despite successful additions. FIX: Modify get_favorite_restaurants function in server.py lines 1195-1224 to handle both database restaurants (UUID IDs) and Google Places restaurants (google_ prefixed IDs) by fetching Google Places data when needed. This explains the heart icon behavior - frontend successfully adds favorites but retrieval fails, causing hearts to appear unfilled and empty favorites dashboard."
  - agent: "testing"
    message: "🎉 GOOGLE PLACES FAVORITES BUG COMPLETELY FIXED! Successfully identified and resolved the critical issue. ROOT CAUSE: The get_favorite_restaurants function was using the legacy Google Places API (maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/place/details/json) which returned REQUEST_DENIED because legacy APIs are not enabled for this project. SOLUTION: Updated the function to use the new Google Places API (places.googleapis.com/v1/places/{place_id}) with proper headers and field masks, matching the same API used in restaurant search. COMPREHENSIVE TEST RESULTS: ✅ All 8/8 focused favorites tests passed, ✅ Users can add Google Places restaurants to favorites, ✅ GET /api/users/favorites now returns complete restaurant details from Google Places API, ✅ Mixed favorites (database + Google Places) work correctly, ✅ Heart icon state management issue should now be resolved. The fix ensures Google Places restaurants are properly retrieved with names, addresses, ratings, and cuisine types."
