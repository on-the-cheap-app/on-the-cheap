The previous AI engineer successfully developed the On-the-Cheap application from MVP to a feature-rich product, integrating Google Places/Geocoding, user authentication, and restaurant owner portals. The core work involved extensive debugging and refinement across both backend (FastAPI, MongoDB) and frontend (React, shadcn/ui). A significant effort was made to implement and stabilize a user registration and favorites system, which required fixing data mismatches and state synchronization issues between components. Subsequently, the Google Geocoding API was fully integrated to enhance location search. Most recently, the focus shifted to populating current specials data for non-registered restaurants, leading to API research and a plan for a multi-source free-tier integration strategy, with Zomato and Foursquare APIs identified for initial implementation. The immediate next step involves fetching integration playbooks for these APIs.

<product_requirements>
The On-the-Cheap application aims to help users find local restaurant and bar specials. Key features include searching by city/address, GPS-based near me functionality (5-mile radius default), displaying only current specials, and allowing restaurant owners to register, claim restaurants, and manage their specials. The app also integrates Google Places API for restaurant data and Google Geocoding API for address conversion. A user registration/login system was added for regular users to save favorite restaurants and personalize their experience. The application is deployed on Vercel (frontend) and Render (backend), using MongoDB Atlas. The current objective is to populate current specials data for restaurants not managed by registered owners, potentially through external APIs.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on integrating external APIs to populate current specials data for restaurants without registered owners.

The user initially reported issues with the favorites functionality, where clicked hearts were not saving and favorites were not listed. This led to extensive debugging:
1.  **Backend Fix**: It was discovered that the  function in  was failing to retrieve Google Places restaurant details due to using an outdated API call. This was fixed by updating it to use the new Google Places API, ensuring that favorited Google Places restaurants are correctly retrieved.
2.  **Frontend Fix**: A critical issue was found where  and  components had unsynchronized  states. This was resolved by modifying  to pass  and  as props to , and updating  to use these props, thereby unifying the state management for favorites. Duplicate function declarations in  were also fixed.
3.  **Deployment Issue**: Through debugging with the user, it was identified that the user was testing the deployed Vercel version () while all the fixes were implemented and tested on the local development environment (). All debugging code was then removed from the frontend and backend, and the fixes were made ready for deployment to the live site.

Following the favorites fix, the user requested the ability to pull current specials data for restaurants without registered owners. The AI researched various external APIs (Zomato, Foursquare, Yelp, Groupon) and provided a detailed pricing comparison. The recommended immediate next step, agreed upon by the user, is to implement a free-tier combo using Zomato API for specials data and Foursquare API for general restaurant data.

The current task is to proceed with this external data integration, and the AI has just initiated fetching the integration playbook for the Zomato API.
