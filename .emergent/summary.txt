<analysis>
The AI engineer successfully guided the user from an initial product idea (On-the-Cheap restaurant specials app) to a deployed, feature-rich MVP. The process involved clarifying requirements, integrating external APIs (Google Places), creating mock data, developing both frontend (React with shadcn/ui) and backend (FastAPI with MongoDB), and deploying the application on Vercel and Render. Key challenges included debugging deployment issues (missing , MongoDB SSL, Render build commands, Railway free tier limitations) and refining search functionality. The AI demonstrated strong problem-solving by iterating on fixes, and proactively addressing user needs like geocoding and user authentication. The last major task was implementing a comprehensive user registration and favorites system.

<product_requirements>
The core product is On-the-Cheap, an application to search for local restaurant and bar specials (happy hour, lunch, blue plate, etc.). Initial requirements included searching by city/address, GPS-based near me functionality (default 5-mile radius), displaying only current specials, and restaurant owners being able to add/edit their specials after registration. The user requested mock data for MVP demo, and explicit integration with Google Places API. Subsequently, the user requested a Restaurant Owner Portal for claiming restaurants and managing specials. Most recently, the user requested adding a User Registration/Login system for regular users to save favorite restaurants and personalize their experience. The application is now fully deployed and includes these features.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Frontend**: React, shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS, Axios
- **Backend**: FastAPI, MongoDB (Motor, Pydantic), JWT, Uvicorn, httpx
- **APIs**: Google Places API (for restaurant data), Google Geocoding API (for address conversion)
- **Deployment**: Vercel (frontend), Render.com (backend), MongoDB Atlas (database)
- **Authentication**: JWT-based for both users and restaurant owners
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture: React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB database.



- ****: This is the core of the FastAPI backend. It defines API endpoints for restaurant search (integrating Google Places and mock specials), special types, restaurant owner registration/login, restaurant claiming, special management (CRUD), and now, regular user registration/login, user profile management, and favorite restaurant management. It handles MongoDB interactions, JWT token creation/verification, password hashing, and geocoding.
- ****: The main React component. It handles global state, search functionality, displaying restaurants and specials, integrating with the backend API, and managing the visibility of the Restaurant Owner Portal and UserAuth modals. Recent changes include adding state for  and , integrating , and adding a Heart icon for favoriting restaurants.
- ****: A newly created React component. This component provides the UI for user registration, login, and a personal dashboard for regular users. It allows users to view and manage their favorite restaurants and provides profile information. It interacts directly with the backend's user authentication and favorites endpoints.
- ** & **: These files store environment variables like , , , and . They are critical for configuring database connections, API keys, and secure authentication across different environments.
- ****: Lists all Python dependencies required for the FastAPI backend. It was updated to include  and  for JWT.
- ****: Manages Node.js dependencies for the React frontend, including React, ReactDOM, Axios, Radix UI components, and Lucide React icons.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer completed the implementation of the User Registration System and Favorite Restaurants feature for regular users. This involved significant updates to both the backend and frontend.

**Backend () Changes:**
- Defined new Pydantic models for , , , and .
- Modified  to distinguish between regular users and restaurant owners.
- Added  for user-specific authentication.
- Added new endpoints:
    - : To register new regular users.
    - : To log in regular users.
    - : To fetch current regular user information.
    -  (POST/DELETE): To add/remove restaurants from user favorites.
    -  (GET): To retrieve a list of a user's favorite restaurants with details.
- Updated  and owner registration/login responses to include .

**Frontend () Changes:**
- Imported  component and ,  icons.
- Added state variables: , , .
- Implemented  to check for logged-in users and fetch favorites on load.
- Added , , , ,  functions.
- Modified the header to display Sign In or the current user's name, and to toggle the  modal.
- Integrated a clickable Heart icon on each restaurant card to toggle favorites, showing red if favorited.
- Added the  modal to the main application's render.

**New Frontend File () Creation:**
- This file contains the React component for the user authentication modal (login/registration forms) and the user's dashboard (displaying favorite restaurants, profile information). It uses Shadcn/ui components for a polished look and interacts with the new backend user API endpoints.

These changes were committed to GitHub, triggering automatic deployments on Render (backend) and Vercel (frontend), which are expected to be live now.
